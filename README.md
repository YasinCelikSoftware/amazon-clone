# Getting Started with Create React App

I will try to the clone the Amazon as I can. I used Material UI, React-Redux etc. in this project. The Readme file will be updated later.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
